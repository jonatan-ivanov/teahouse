== System architecture

--> Tea Service
\ --->  Tealeaf Service  ---> DB
\ --->  Water Service    ---> DB

Poor man's version poll:

* Observability in production?
* Spring Boot 3?
* Micrometer?
* Prometheus
* OpenTelemetry?

=== What is observability?

"How well we can understand the internals of a system based on its outputs"

=== Jumping through pillars

* logs <-- through traces --> metrics
* logs <-- trace id --> traces
* traces -- through tags -- > metrics
* metrics -- through exemplars --> traces

== DEMO TIME

Time for the teahouse demo!

Characteristics:

* Spring Boot 3 apps
** Instrumented with Micrometer Observation
** Metrics plugged in via Micrometer Core
** Tracing plugged in via Micrometer Tracing
*** Tracer - OpenZipkin Brave (you could pick OpenTelemetry)
