== Poll

Poor man's version poll:

* Observability in production?
* Spring Boot 3?
* Micrometer?
* Prometheus?
* OpenTelemetry?

=== What is observability?

"How well we can understand the internals of a system based on its outputs"

== System architecture

```
--> Tea Service --> RabbitMq --> Reporting Service --> Mongo Db
\ ---> Proxy Service --->  Tealeaf Service  ---> DB
\ ---> Water Service ---> DB
```

== DEMO TIME

Time for the teahouse demo!

IMPORTANT: CHECK THE DOCS https://docs.micrometer.io

=== Jumping through pillars

* logs <-- through traces --> metrics
* logs <-- trace id --> traces
* traces -- through tags -- > metrics
* metrics -- through exemplars --> traces
