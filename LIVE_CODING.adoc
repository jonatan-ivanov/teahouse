== System architecture

--> Tea Service
\ --->  Tealeaf Service  ---> DB
\ --->  Water Service    ---> DB

Poor man's version poll:

* Do you know what Distributed Tracing is?
* Are you using Observability (whatever that means) in production?

=== What is observability?

How well we can understand the internals of a system based on its outputs

== DEMO TIME

Time for the teahouse demo!

Characteristics:

* Spring Boot 3 apps
** Instrumented with Micrometer Observation
** Metrics plugged in via Micrometer Core
** Tracing plugged in via Micrometer Tracing
*** Tracer - OpenZipkin Brave (you could pick OpenTelemetry)

== Micrometer Observation Coding

* Separate Metrics, Tracing instrumentation (`WaterServiceMetricsAndTracing`)
* Combining instrumentation using Micrometer Observation (`WaterServiceObservability`)
** Aspect (`WaterObservationConfiguration`)
* Customizations
** Custom handler (`WaterFetcherObservationHandler`)
** Observation filter (`WaterObservationConfiguration`)
** Observation predicate (`WaterObservationConfiguration`)
** Observation documentation (`./gradlew generateObservabilityDocs`)
